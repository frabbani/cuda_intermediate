# ExposureValue: 
#   Controls the simulated camera exposure level. This is a logarithmic value in EV units (Exposure Value).
#
# GrayKey: 
#   defines the reference gray luminance used in tone mapping. Based on photographic tone reproduction models.
#   0.18 is standard middle gray (18% reflectance), mimicking camera/eye adaptation to average light.
#   Lowering this value darken the image. Raising it will map more of the image towards midtones.
#
# InScatterAttenuation:
#   Controls how bloom contribution attenuates through the lense during inscattering.
#   Higher values restrict bloom to only very bright areas. Lower values allow bloom spread from lesser.

# InScatterWeights:
#   Defines the relative contribution of small, medium, large and extra large bloom spreads respectively.
#   This shapes the bloom profile. The 4 values must be comma separated. The values are normalized, ie the 
#   sum contribution of these weights will always be 1.
