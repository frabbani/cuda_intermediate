== Input Phase ==
FS -> Host: Load HDR image
FS -> Host: Load control parameters
Host -> Syms: Upload symbols (exposure, gray key, bloom alpha, weights)

== Processing Phase ==
activate Lum
activate Bloom
Host -> Lum: Launch log-average luminance kernels
Host -> Bloom: Launch in-scatter/bloom extraction & mipmap blur kernels
Syms -> Bloom: Access bloom alpha and weights
Lum --> Host: Return average log luminance
Bloom --> Host: Return composite bloom result
deactivate Lum
deactivate Bloom
Host -> FS: Save bloom and mipmap outputs

== Aggregation Phase ==
activate Global
Host -> Global: Launch tone-mapping kernel with image + bloom + luminance
Syms -> Global: Access tone-mapping and exposure params
Global --> Host: Return final tone-mapped image
deactivate Global
Host -> FS: Save final output image
